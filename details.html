          <li>
            The athlete begins running from his or her starting position
            and jumps, landing in a sand pit. There is a foul line, in the runup area, that the athlete
            has
            to be aware of;
            Jumping from beyond this line results in a 'foul jump'. Jumpers
            try to get as close to the foul line as legally possible before
            initiating their jump.</li>
          <li>
            -No part of the athlete's foot should cross the front edge of the
            foul line. If, at the point of take-off, any part of his foot crosses
            the front edge of the foul line, then the jump is termed to be
            illegal or a 'foul jump', and does not count.</li>
          <li>
            -The long jumper has three attempts to register his or her best
            legal jump. A foul jump accounts for an attempt. Only the
            farthest legal jump counts.</li>
          <li>
            -The distance or the 'jump' is measured from the front edge of
            the foul line to the first landing point of the athlete, from the
            first point of contact.
