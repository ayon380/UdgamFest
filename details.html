                    <li>
                        The athlete begins running from his or her starting position
                        and jumps, landing in a sand pit. There is a foul line, in the runup area, that the athlete
                        has
                        to be aware of;
                        Jumping from beyond this line results in a 'foul jump'. Jumpers
                        try to get as close to the foul line as legally possible before
                        initiating their jump.</li>
                    <li>
                        -No part of the athlete's foot should cross the front edge of the
                        foul line. If, at the point of take-off, any part of his foot crosses
                        the front edge of the foul line, then the jump is termed to be
                        illegal or a 'foul jump', and does not count.</li>
                    <li>
                        -The long jumper has three attempts to register his or her best
                        legal jump. A foul jump accounts for an attempt. Only the
                        farthest legal jump counts.</li>
                    <li>
                        -The distance or the 'jump' is measured from the front edge of
                        the foul line to the first landing point of the athlete, from the
                        first point of contact.
